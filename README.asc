= Slides for Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS

This is part of the sample application for the presentation "Full Stack Java with JSweet, Angular 2, PrimeNG, and JAX-RS",
originally given at JavaOne in September, 2016 by https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitomann[Kito D. Mann] from
https://virtua.tech[Virtua, Inc.]. It demonstrates how you can write an https://angular.io[Angular 2] application with
http://www.primefaces.org/primeng/[PrimeNG] components using Java (courtesy of the
 http://jsweet.org[JSweet] transpiler), and have it talk to a standard Java back-end using https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/[JAX-RS].
